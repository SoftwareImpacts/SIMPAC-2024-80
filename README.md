# ARIMA_LSTM
This repository is created as part of a collaborative research on development of ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model with Random forest techique for input lag selection: An hybrid model technique for predicting volatile price index series.
It is a step-by-step process to create a hybrid statistical and then machine learning model through different statistical assumptions.
